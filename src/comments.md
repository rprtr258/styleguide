- no commented code and no code `not used for now, will be needed in future` or `though it is unused now, maybe it will be need in future`
- comments are for things which can't be expressed as code, e.g. links to issues, standards, docs, implementation explanation details, formulas, etc.
- strive to reduce `TODO` comments, instead open issues to fix the problem
- comment complex logic, unsafe code, hacks. In most other cases clear naming is enough.
- do not use comments to just rephrase what is being done in code, as I can read the code itself
